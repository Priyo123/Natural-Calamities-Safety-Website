    <h3>
        If You Feel a Strong Coastal Earthquake
    </h3>
    <h4>Drop, cover, and hold on to protect yourself from the earthquake.<br>

        • When the shaking stops, gather members of your household and review your evacuation plan. A tsunami may be coming within minutes.
        <br>
        • Use a NOAA Weather Radio or stay tuned to a Coast Guard emergency frequency station, or a local radio or television station for updated emergency information.
        <br>
        • Follow instructions issued by local authorities. Recommended evacuation routes may be different from the one you planned, or you may be advised to climb higher.
        <br>
        • If you hear an official tsunami warning or detect signs of a tsunami, evacuate at once. A tsunami warning is issued when authorities are certain that a tsunami threat exists, and there may be little time to get out.
        <br>
        • Take your emergency preparedness kit. Having supplies will make you more comfortable during the evacuation.
        <br>
        • If you evacuate, take your animals with you. If it is not safe for you, it is not safe for them.
        <br>
        • Get to higher ground as far inland as possible. Watching a tsunami from the beach or cliffs could put you in grave danger. If you can see the wave, you are too close to escape it.
        <br>
        • Avoid downed power lines and stay away from buildings and bridges from which heavy objects might fall during an aftershock.
        <br>
        • Stay away until local officials tell you it is safe. A tsunami is a series of waves that may continue for hours. Do not assume that after one wave the danger is over. The next wave may be larger than the first one.
