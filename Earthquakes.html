    <h3>What Should You Do During an Earthquake?</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>
        DROP, COVER and HOLD ON!
        <br>
Move as little as possible - most injuries during earthquakes occur because of people moving around, falling and suffering sprains, fractures and head injuries.
<br>
Try to protect your head and torso.
<br>
If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, and cover your head.
<br>
Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.
<br>
If you must leave a building after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.
<br>
Be aware that smoke alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.
<br>
If you smell gas, get out of the house and move as far away as possible.
<br>
Before you leave any building check to make sure that there is no debris from the building that could fall on you.

    <h3>
      Staying Safe Outdoors  
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Find a clear spot and drop to the ground. Stay there until the shaking stops.
        <br>
        Try to get as far away from buildings, power lines, trees, and streetlights as possible.
        <br>
        If you're in a vehicle, pull over to a clear location and stop. Avoid bridges, overpasses and power lines if possible.
        <br>
        Stay inside with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.
        <br>
        After the shaking has stopped, drive on carefully, avoiding bridges and ramps that may have been damaged.
        <br>
        If a power line falls on your vehicle, do not get out. Wait for assistance.
        <br>
        If you are in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling rocks and other debris as well as landslides.
